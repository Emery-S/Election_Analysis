# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has requested, for a local congressional election, the following:
    1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
    2. Get a list of participating counties in the data set
    3. Calculate voter turnout for each county
    4. Calculate the percentage voter turnout of each county
    5. Determine the county with the largest voter turnout
    6. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes
    7. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved
    8. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
    9. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote
    10. Get a list of participating counties in the data set
    11. Calculate voter turnout for each county
    12. Calculate the percentage voter turnout of each county
    13. Determine the county with the largest voter turnout
    
This analysis is to better understand the results of the election as well as help better understand each counties turnout and, therefore, influence.

## Election-Audit Summary
This audit can help the government or future candidates get a better understanding of where voters come from. This would influence campaign work as well as election and voting reminders, perhap increasing more of them in places with lower voter turn out. It also demonstrates who won and by how much they won. It gives a look into the mindset of those specific counties and what they think they need which could influece future governmental proceedings as well as future elections and the different campaigns involved. This audit covers a basic, but essential portion of the election data. It could likely be refactored to analyze even more information such as population size per county verses voter turnout, if those data points are added to the data set.
